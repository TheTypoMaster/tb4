To use a logo with the template, just upload a file called logo.png to the images folder (www.your-domain.com/images). One of the easiest methods for doing this is to use Joomla's Media Manager. The logo file dimensions are 227x90 pixels.

Several configuration options are in the parameters section for this template:
  1. Enable/disable loading of default Joomla JavaScript (Disabling the JavaScript will improve page load times, but proceed only with testing as some extensions require the JavaScript to function properly.)
  2. Background color
  3. Color of the thick line at the top and bottom of the page
  4. Menu color

To access these options, log in to the administrator area of your Joomla website, and go here:
Extensions->Template Manager->Shoutbox
